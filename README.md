# DSA Assignment: Dynamic Programming

Welcome to MP4, an assignment dedicated to Dynamic Programming! This is one of the most versatile and powerful algorithms you'll come across. Mastering it can lead to solutions for many complex problems that may seem intractable at first glance.

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note
The key to solving dynamic programming questions is to truly comprehend the value you intend to memoize. This will not only optimize your solution but also provide clarity in structuring your approach.

## Help and Support

- **General Questions**: If you have any general questions or concepts that you'd like to discuss, head over to the [discussion forum](#).

- **Code-specific Questions**: If your issue is specific to the code you're writing, you can either commit and push your code and then open a pull request to ask for feedback or use the GitHub discussions feature. 

- **Errors or Issues**: If you stumble upon any errors or issues in the assignment, please get in touch with @yokurang on Telegram or drop an email at <alan.matthew@u.yale-nus.edu.sg>.

## Testing

Make use of `pytest` to test your questions. All the relevant test cases are neatly organized in the `tests` folder. Remember, there are no hidden tests. If your code is passing all the tests after you push, your solution is on the right track. Do ensure your code is original as we'll be using MOSS to check for plagiarism.

## Submission Details

To kick-start the assignment, click on the assignment link at the top. This will guide you through setting up your private repository. As you work through the questions, push your solutions to this repository. We'll be grading the last commit you make before **November 15, 2023, 23:59 SGT**.

## Order of Questions:

1. `fib.py`: A classic problem to understand the essence of dynamic programming.
2. `robots.py`: This is a cornerstone for this module. **Highly recommended** to grasp the intricacies of this problem as it will be extremely beneficial for the final exam.
3. `taro.py`: A fun problem involving activities and maximizing happiness.
4. `randomness.py`: Delve into the world of probabilities and dynamic programming.
5. `lcs.py`: Understand the concept of subsequences and how dynamic programming can be applied.

## Note to Remember

For this assignment, focus only on the Dynamic Programming concepts taught in the course. Other methods might solve the problem, but the idea is to practice and internalize dynamic programming techniques.
