Problem: Tossing Random Variables Probability

Description:
Given an odd number `N`, we have `N` random variables numbered from 1 to `N`. For each random variable `i` (1â‰¤iâ‰¤N), the probability of the outcome being 1 (analogous to heads) is `p_i` and the probability of the outcome being 0 (analogous to tails) is `1-p_i`. Taro has observed all the `N` random variables. Determine the probability of observing more 1s than 0s.

Function Signature:
def probability_more_ones(N: int, probabilities: List[float]) -> float:

Inputs:
    - N (int): An odd number representing the total number of random variables.
    - probabilities (List[float]): A list of probabilities `p_i` indicating the probability that the i-th random variable has an outcome of 1.

Returns:
    - float: The probability of observing more 1s than 0s after observing all N random variables.

Examples:
1. Input: N = 3, probabilities = [0.3, 0.6, 0.8]
   Output: 0.396
   Explanation: 
   The probability of observing 2 outcomes of 1 and 1 outcome of 0 is: 0.3 * 0.6 * (1-0.8) + 0.3 * (1-0.6) * 0.8 + (1-0.3) * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.216.
   The probability of observing 3 outcomes of 1 is: 0.3 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.144.
   Total probability = 0.216 + 0.144 = 0.36.

2. Input: N = 1, probabilities = [0.5]
   Output: 0.5
   Explanation: 
   Since there's only one random variable, the probability of observing more 1s than 0s is the same as the probability of the random variable having an outcome of 1.

Notes:
    - This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] represent the probability of observing `j` outcomes of 1 after observing the first `i` random variables. The transition formula is:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * p_i + dp[i-1][j] * (1-p_i)
    - The answer will be the sum of probabilities for observing more than N/2 outcomes of 1, which is dp[N][N/2 + 1] + dp[N][N/2 + 2] + ... + dp[N][N].
